# Introduction

Since launching Firefox OS, Mozilla has been approached by countless developers with a simple question: “How do I make apps for Firefox OS?” The answer: “It’s the web; use existing web technologies.” was—and still is—a good answer.

But if you don’t already have an existing toolchain, we've created a collection of Javascript libraries and tools that you can use to write your next web app. From project creation to templating to deployment, Mozilla’s Rec Room will help you quickly create awesome web apps in less time. 

## What is Rec Room?

Rec Room is a collection of JavaScript libraries and tools curated by Mozilla. It aims to help you build first-class web applications and improve your productivity. It includes:

* [Brick]() to add components like appbars and buttons to your UI
* [Ember]() for your app’s controllers, models, and views
* [Handlebars]() to write your app’s templates
* [Grunt]() to run the tasks for your app, including building for production
* [I18n.js]() to localize your app
* [Mocha]() to test your app
* [Stylus]() to write your CSS
* [Yeoman]() to scaffold new code for your app’s models and templates

## Is Rec Room for Me?

Rec Room is **not** the only way to make mobile web apps for FirefoxOS. If however you're just getting started with building complex modern web applications, have been frustrated by the sheer number of choices available, or just want a toolchain that works, Rec Room is for you.

Using Rec Room requires some knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, but our goal is to accelerate the app development process even for beginners. Rec Room uses [Ember.js]() as the framework to build your app’s controllers, models, and views. While you don’t need to know Ember.js, some previous knowledge would be useful. 

## Get Started

This series of articles aims to teach you the fundamentals of modern web app development and get you up to speed quickly, introducing the Rec Room bundle’s different features as we go.


### Intro to Firefox OS (gray box 1)

Throughout this Quickstart when we refer to "Firefox OS apps," we're talking specifically about creating an open web app that runs on [Firefox OS][link goes here]. 

But since Firefox OS apps are built using Web technologies, the techniques we describe should work for any open web app, regardless of platform. 

This also means that all that you've learned about HTML, CSS and Javascript applies to developing apps for the Firefox OS platform.
