# Installation

Rec Room is controlled using a set of command line tools. On your given platform (Mac, Linux, or Windows), you will use a terminal or command prompt to use Rec Room.

### Install Rec Room

1. RecRoom requires Node.js. Follow [these instructions]() to download and install it before you do the next steps.
2. Open your Terminal or command line now.
3. Install Rec Room using the node package manager (NPM).
```
npm install -g recroom
```
4. If the installation was successful, you’ll see the following.

*Warning:* If you get an error about permissions and are on Linux, Mac OS X, or another flavor of Unix, you may have issues with the ownership of your .npm directory. See [Stack Overflow - NPM throws errors without sudo](). We strongly encourage people not to use sudo with npm, as packages can execute arbitrary scripts.

### Install a Text Editor

To effectively create mobile web apps, you’ll need either a text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE). We recommend [Sublime Text](), which includes an unlimited free trial. [Brackets]() is also an excellent free, cross-platform text editor.

### Install Testing and Debugging Tools

You’ll need a web browser to view, debug, and test your mobile web app. We recommend [Firefox Nightly](). It has great [Developer Tools]() and cutting-edge support for emerging Web Standards. Its [Responsive Design View]() is also great for testing your app’s phone and tablet layouts.

That’s it! You’re now ready to create your first Rec Room project.
